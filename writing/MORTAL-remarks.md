MORTAL Remarks

- First, I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me to be here and setting the stage for this session.

- As many of you are aware, life expectancy at birth in the US has not only stagnated, but actually declined in recent years, even before the disaster of the COVID-19 epidemic. The reasons for the decline were not well understood at the time, though there was plenty of speculation.

- And I'd be shocked if you had not heard about one dominant explanation for the (pre-COVID) decline, and that is the rise in so-called 'deaths of despair'. This was a compelling story told by the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, which analyzed mortality data and emphasized the simultaneous rise of drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related deaths, but largely in the white population. 

- This has been a huge story, here featured in two high profile pieces in the New York Times, and a story that has largely centered on the idea that the decline in life expectancy was chiefly due to adverse experiences of low educated, middle aged white men and the disintegration of their economic opportunities in recent years. Case and Deaton also placed a lot of emphasis on deaths of despair as a response to the pain of declining opportunity, and it is worth noting that such an empathetic narrative was mostly absent during prior 'epidemics' that affected nonwhite populations.

- I'd like to raise 3 questions regarding the attention given to the story Case and Deaton are telling. First, does the basic pattern even exist? I think at this point there are many (some of whom are in this room) who would argue that the evidence for is, at best, inconsistent.

- The second question is about the concept of 'despair'. Case and Deaton more recently argued there is an 'ocean' of pain and mental health distress plaguing Americans without a university degree (BA). Yet the literature on this is somewhat mixed, and even if one accepts that self-reports of pain may be increasing, the increases seem small relative to the increases in mortality.

- Here I'm just showing some simple age-adjusted calculations for 

- But physical pain is also perhaps different, and has different antecedents, than psychological pain. Case and Deaton are keen to point out (rightly) that there is no objective marker for distress, but argue in 

- Measures like life expectancy are valuable in the sense of being easy to understand, but they measure a complex reality of causes, and can lend themselves to simplistic narratives, like 'deaths of despair'. However, one can decompose differences and changes in life expectancy to help understand whether existing narratives are compelling explanations.  We recently used a series of analyses decomposing the decline in life expectancy, but went beyond just population averages and looked at heterogeneity by race/ethnicity, gender, and causes of death. But what we found was hard to reconcile with the 'deaths of despair' narrative. 

- Next, lets' talk about race. Here I'm showing you the results of decomposing the decline in US life expectancy from 2014 to 2017, and the contribution of different causes of death by race/ethnicity for men. What we found was that, contrary to the 'despair' narrative, it was actually non-Hispanic black men, not non-Hispanic white men, who had experienced the largest decline in life expectancy during this period, a decline of 0.65 years, nearly double that of whites. Moreover, although opioid overdoses (included here as 'unintentional poisoning') contributed to the decline for all races, increases in homicide accounted for a larger share of the decline among blacks. Yet, homicide, which remains deeply connected to persistent systemic racism in the US, has been mostly ignored in the 'deaths of despair' narrative. In addition, you can see that suicide deaths, also featured prominently in the 'despair' narrative, made little contribution to life expectancy decline in any group. 

- And for women it was also worth noting that non-Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islanders lost nearly as much life expectancy (0.23 years) as did white women, though this was not due to opioid overdoses. These complex and specific changes are hard to tie into a simple narrative about working class white men.

- Finally, it's worth noting that the whole idea of death of despair as a phenomenon has been harder to reconcile with demographic changes in the overdose epidemic. Blacks and American Indian / Alaska Natives are now experiencing the greatest burden, and we won't be able to take action to reduce these lost lives by adhering to outdated and incomplete narratives, even if they contain some grains of truth. 


- To sum up. 

While increases in mortality gaps for heart disease and cancer both contributed to the growing gap in mortality between education groups, it was the rise in deaths of despair among those with less than a bachelorâ€™s degree that largely accounts for the widening of the all-cause mortality gap.
